# Downloading ClickCrystals

Hyped up and ready to script? Let’s download the mod itself!

## Disclaimer

Before downloading ClickCrystals, you must first acknowledge the fake copies that exist on the internet out there. Unfortunately, things like this happen, and it is likely that someone out there is using the name of ClickCrystals to spread malware; most of the time it is someone taking advantage of <70 IQ people to download their infected software.

## Downloading

Please make sure that you only download the .jar from trusted sources. We would encourage most users to download our project on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/clickcrystals). If you don’t trust the CurseForge site, you can always visit Modrinth, but it is not recommended due to content rule compatibility issues and has been discontinued.

You can always visit our [Github](https://github.com/ItziSpyder/ClickCrystals) releases and source code. Our [site](https://clickcrystals.xyz) links all asset downloads to Github as well.

## Versions 

If you are unsure what version you should download, all ClickCrystals assets are formatted as such `ClickCrystals-<minecraftVersion>-<clickcrystalsVersion>.jar`. 

> ex. "ClickCrystals-1.21.8-1.3.4.jar"

You can visit a table of what you need to download from [here](https://github.com/clickcrystals-development/ClickCrystals?tab=readme-ov-file#what-version-should-i-get)
